to make it work:

    run $ cd front
        $ npm i
        $ npm start
        $ cd ..
        $ cd back
        $ npm i
        $ npm run server // or run node server/server.js if you don't have nodemon installed globally

need to have mongo installed on your computer for the backend to work(or link the database with another database in the db folder, db.js file)
